    "1. It looks like the ngrams display that flattening the lists of ingredients into 1 long string is not a great idea, as you can see things like \"buttermilk cup purpose\" and that doesn't have much meaning. The original repo['ingredients'] has each recipe's ingredients contained in a list of strings for each record. Flattening the entire corpus probably works ok to get the entire vocabulary, but it isn't as helpful if we want each 'ingredient' in the list to be a 'sentence' in a 'document'. For example, 'apple cider vinegar' is useful but 'apple cider vinegar cup' looks like it read in the first word from the next ingredient.\n",
